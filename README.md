# Open Source Security with Anchore & Snyk

Open source software components and dependencies are increasingly making up a vast majority of software applications. Along with the increased usage of OSS comes the inherent security risks these packages present. Enterprises looking to adopt a greater open source footprint should also employ effective tooling and processes to identify, manage, and mitigate the potential risks these libraries impose. 

Containers have been gaining popularity as well among enterprises. Uniquely allowing for development and packaging of applications and their dependencies to improve consistency and speed of production deployments. By nature of consistency, the quality of development and software releases also improves. 

Recognizing that container images need an added layer of security, Anchore conducts a deep image inspection and analysis uncovering what is within the image (packages, files, software artifacts). Following analysis, user-defined acceptance policies are evaluated against the analzyed data to certify the container images.
