# Open Source Security with Anchore & Snyk

Open source software components and dependencies are increasingly making up a vast majority of software applications. Along with the increased usage of OSS comes the inherent security risks these packages present. Enterprises looking to adopt a greater open source footprint should also employ effective tooling and processes to identify, manage, and mitigate the potential risks these libraries impose. 

Anchore is a service that conducts a deep image inspection and analysis of container images. In short, Anchore is uncovering what is contained within the image (packages, files, software artifacts). Following analysis, user-defined acceptance policies are evaluated against the analzyed data to certify the container images.
